### Day 2 - constructor

*(Date: 27-Dec-2025)*

- Learned the concept of `constructors` in Java, including their rules and role in initializing objects.
- Practiced `constructor overloading` `using default`, `parameterized`, and `copy` constructors.
- Learned `access modifiers` (`public`, `protected`, `default`, and `private`) along with their scope of accessibility.
- Differentiated between `instance` and `class` (static) variables and methods using practical examples.
- Successfully completed all assigned programs and verified the output results.

### Day 3 -  Java Inbuilt Keywords (this, static, final, instanceof)

*(Date: 29-Dec-2025)*

- Understood the purpose and usage of the `this` keyword to refer to the current object and resolve variable ambiguity and contructor chaining.
- Learned the `static` keyword and its use with variables, methods, and blocks to share data across objects.
- Studied the `final` keyword and its application with variables, methods, and classes to restrict modification and inheritance.
- Practiced the `instanceof` keyword to check object type and ensure safe type casting.
- Completed multiple real-world programs to strengthen understanding and practical implementation of these keywords.

### Day 4 - Classes, Objects & UML Diagrams

*(Date: 30-Dec-2025)*

- Understood the difference between `classes` and `objects`, where a class acts as a blueprint and objects represent real instances created at runtime.
- Learned about `class diagrams` and how they define the static structure of a system using classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.
- Studied `object diagrams` to visualize actual object instances and their state at a specific point in time.
- Explored `sequence diagrams` to understand the flow of interactions and method calls between objects in a time-ordered manner.
- Successfully completed all assigned programs and verified the output results.

### Day 5 - Inheritance

*(Date: 31-Dec-2025)*

- Learned the concept of `inheritance` and how one class can acquire properties and methods of another class.
- Studied `single-level` inheritance and its use when one child class inherits from one parent class.
- Understood `multilevel` inheritance where a class inherits from another derived class.
- Learned `hierarchical` inheritance where multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.
- Explored the key features of inheritance such as `code reusability` and `method overriding`.
- Practiced `method overriding` to achieve runtime polymorphism.
- Understood how `constructors` work in inheritance and the role of the super keyword.
- Studied how `access modifiers` affect inheritance and member visibility across classes.
- Successfully completed all assigned programs and verified the output results.

### Day 6 - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism

*(Date: 01-Jan-2026)*

- Learned `encapsulation` and its role in data hiding and security.
- Practiced using `getter` and `setter` methods to access private data safely.
- Studied `polymorphism` and its importance in achieving flexibility in code.
- Learned about `method overloading` as an example of `compile-time polymorphism`.
- Practiced `method overriding` to achieve `runtime polymorphism`.
- Understood `abstraction` and its purpose in hiding implementation details.
- Studied `abstract classes` and how they provide `partial abstraction`.
- Learned `interfaces` and how they define `complete abstraction` and `multiple inheritance` support.
