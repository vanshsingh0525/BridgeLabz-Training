### Day 2 - Stack, Queue, HashMap and Hashing Functions

*(Date: 03-Jan-2026)*

- Learned the concept of stack and its working based on the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- Studied queue and its working based on the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
- Practiced basic stack and queue operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Learned the concept of hashing and how a hashing function works.
- Studied HashMap in Java and how it stores data using key–value pairs for fast access.

### Day 3 - Sorting Algorithms

*(Date: 05-Jan-2026)*

- Studied and implemented different sorting algorthims.
- `Bubble Sort`: Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements until the list is fully sorted.
- `Insertion Sort`: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
- `Merge Sort`: Uses a divide-and-conquer approach to split the array and merge sorted subarrays into a final sorted array.
- `Quick Sort`: Partitions the array around a pivot and recursively sorts the subarrays for efficient average performance.
- `Counting Sort`: Sorts elements by counting occurrences of each value, making it efficient for a known, limited range of integers.
- `Selection Sort`: Repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and places it at the correct position.
- `Heap Sort`: Uses a heap data structure to repeatedly extract the maximum or minimum element to produce a sorted array.

### Day 4 - Linear and Binary Search

*(Date: 06-Jan-2026)*

- Learned `StringBuilder` and how it allows mutable string operations with better performance in a single-threaded environment.
- Studied `StringBuffer` and how it provides thread-safe mutable string operations using synchronization.
- Learned `FileReader` to read character data directly from files.
- Studied `InputStreamReader` to convert byte streams into character streams.
- Learned `Linear Search` and how it sequentially checks each element to find a target value.
- Studied `Binary Search` and how it efficiently searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

### Day 5 - Runtime Analysis

*(Date: 07-Jan-2026)*

- Learned `runtime analysis` and how it evaluates the efficiency of an algorithm based on time and space usage.
- Studied `Big-O notation` to express algorithm performance and scalability as input size grows.
- Understood `time complexity` analysis to measure how execution time increases with input size.
- Learned `space complexity` analysis to evaluate the amount of memory an algorithm requires.
- Studied `best`, `worst`, and `average case complexities` to analyze algorithm behavior under different conditions.
- Learned practical guidelines for optimizing Java code by reducing unnecessary computations and improving performance.
