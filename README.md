## Week 4 : Java Collections Concepts

### Day 1 – Java Generics (Fundamentals & Scenarios)

*(Date: 15-Jan-2026)*

- Learned Generics basics: type safety, reusability, compile-time checks, and removal of type casting.
- Practiced generic classes, methods, bounded types, and wildcards.
- Implemented real-world scenarios:
  - Smart Warehouse – Generic storage with bounded types.
  - Online Marketplace – Generic products and discount methods.
  - University Course System – Managed multiple course types using wildcards.
  - Meal Plan Generator – Validated meal categories with bounded generics.
  - AI Resume Screening – Processed resumes for multiple job roles safely.

### Day 2 - Java Collection

*(Date: 16-Jan-2026)*

- Learned the overview of the `Java Collections Framework` and its role in storing and manipulating groups of objects efficiently.
- Understood what the Collections Framework is and how it provides a unified architecture for data structures.
- Studied the hierarchy of the Collections Framework, including core interfaces and their relationships.
- Learned the `List interface` and its implementing classes such as ArrayList and LinkedList for ordered data storage.
- Studied the `Set interface` and its implementing classes to store unique elements without duplication.
- Learned the `Queue` and `Deque interfaces` and how they support FIFO, LIFO, and priority-based operations.
- Studied the `Map interface` and its implementations for storing data in key–value pairs.
- Compared different collection implementations based on performance, ordering, and use cases.
- Learned real-world use cases and best practices for choosing appropriate collection classes in Java.
