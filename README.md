## Week 4 : Java Collections Concepts

### Day 1 – Java Generics (Fundamentals & Scenarios)

*(Date: 15-Jan-2026)*

- Learned Generics basics: type safety, reusability, compile-time checks, and removal of type casting.
- Practiced generic classes, methods, bounded types, and wildcards.
- Implemented real-world scenarios:
  - Smart Warehouse – Generic storage with bounded types.
  - Online Marketplace – Generic products and discount methods.
  - University Course System – Managed multiple course types using wildcards.
  - Meal Plan Generator – Validated meal categories with bounded generics.
  - AI Resume Screening – Processed resumes for multiple job roles safely.

### Day 2 - Java Collection

*(Date: 16-Jan-2026)*

- Learned the overview of the `Java Collections Framework` and its role in storing and manipulating groups of objects efficiently.
- Understood what the Collections Framework is and how it provides a unified architecture for data structures.
- Studied the hierarchy of the Collections Framework, including core interfaces and their relationships.
- Learned the `List interface` and its implementing classes such as ArrayList and LinkedList for ordered data storage.
- Studied the `Set interface` and its implementing classes to store unique elements without duplication.
- Learned the `Queue` and `Deque interfaces` and how they support FIFO, LIFO, and priority-based operations.
- Studied the `Map interface` and its implementations for storing data in key–value pairs.
- Compared different collection implementations based on performance, ordering, and use cases.
- Learned real-world use cases and best practices for choosing appropriate collection classes in Java.

### Day 3 - Java Streams

*(Date: 19-Jan-2026)*

- Learned Java I/O Streams and how they are used to perform input and output operations in Java.
- Studied different types of streams in Java based on data handling and functionality.
- Learned File Streams to read and write data directly from files.
- Studied Object Streams to read and write Java objects using serialization and deserialization.
- Learned ByteArray Streams to handle data in memory using byte arrays.
- Studied Buffered Streams to improve I/O performance by reducing direct disk access.
- Learned Reader and Writer classes to handle character-based input and output operations.
- Understood key considerations such as stream closing, exception handling, and performance impact.
- Learned best practices for Java I/O by using buffering, try-with-resources, and choosing the right stream type.

### Day 4 - Exception Handling

*(Date: 20-Jan-2026)*

- Learned exceptions in Java and how they handle runtime errors to prevent abnormal program termination.
- Studied different types of exceptions in Java including checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Learned custom exceptions to handle application-specific error conditions.
- Studied exception handling using try-catch, finally blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Studied try-with-resources statement to automatically close resources after use.
- Learned the throws clause to declare exceptions that may be passed to the calling method.
- Studied the throw statement to explicitly throw an exception.
- Learned defining constructors in custom exception classes to pass error messages or causes.
