### Day 2 - constructor

*(Date: 27-Dec-2025)*

- Learned the concept of `constructors` in Java, including their rules and role in initializing objects.
- Practiced `constructor overloading` `using default`, `parameterized`, and `copy` constructors.
- Learned `access modifiers` (`public`, `protected`, `default`, and `private`) along with their scope of accessibility.
- Differentiated between `instance` and `class` (static) variables and methods using practical examples.
- Successfully completed all assigned programs and verified the output results.

### Day 3 -  Java Inbuilt Keywords (this, static, final, instanceof)

*(Date: 29-Dec-2025)*

- Understood the purpose and usage of the `this` keyword to refer to the current object and resolve variable ambiguity and contructor chaining.
- Learned the `static` keyword and its use with variables, methods, and blocks to share data across objects.
- Studied the `final` keyword and its application with variables, methods, and classes to restrict modification and inheritance.
- Practiced the `instanceof` keyword to check object type and ensure safe type casting.
- Completed multiple real-world programs to strengthen understanding and practical implementation of these keywords.
